Welcome to my GitHub page 🙌  
I am a Ph.D. student in the US🗽  
Currently, I am working on developing a framework of Real-Time Hybrid Simulation (RTHS) for offshore wind turbines🌎  

In my leisure time, I like working out🏋️‍♀️, taking photography📷, and reading sci-fi books📖  
Also, I like to keep learning something small. Now I am memorizing all the capitals in the states😀  
I believe learning = life, and it is fun! I hope my life is like the loading bar shown below.
