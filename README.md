Welcome to my GitHub page 🙌  
I am a Ph.D. student in the US🗽  
Currently, I am working on developing a framework of ***Real-Time Hybrid Simulation for offshore wind turbines***🌎  

In my leisure time, I like working out🏋️‍♀️, taking photography📷, and reading sci-fi books📖  
Also, I like to keep learning something small. Now I am memorizing all the capitals in the states😀  
***I believe life = learning, and it is fun!🎈*** I wish I could have the life like a loading bar that is always busy with importing something!💻
